# School Information System (SIS)

A service that allows an [Administrator](../roles/administrator.md) to manage the core data that the school needs to operate:  students, teachers, subjects, streams and classes.  This data is then provided (at the minimum level required and under the control of the school) to other services to allow them to function efficiently.  The SIS can also optionally fulfil the role of [Identity Provider](../identity-provider.md) for a school.
