# Use Case Repository

This repository will be the home for all of the use cases that will be explored and validated as part of the pilot phase for the new 'Chain to Ecosystem' pilot during 2020.

## Rationale

This repository is split into the documents that provide a functional overview for how the ecosystem works, with definitions of the high level services, actors, data entities and use cases.

The initial intent is to guide the prototype / validation stage of the process, and keep the work streams aligned through the summer of 2020.  This repository may evolve into the basis for the standards related to the services and APIs.

## Structure

 Documents | description
-----------|---
 [Services](/services)  |  Description of the services that can be provided by any or all participants.
 [Roles](/roles)     |  Description of roles that exist to perform actions in and across the services.
 [Processes](/processes) |  High level functional areas that are used to break down the key exchanges of data across services in the ecosystem.
 [Use Cases](/use-cases) |  Description of a smaller step within a process to allow for functional and technical design, testing and validation.
